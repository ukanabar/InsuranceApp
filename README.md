As requested in assignment i have created really quick mvp version of assignment

Some improvements we can make are as below:
- For database operation write repositories with interfaces as using those interfaces we can do testing
- Adding some tests
- UI can be made better. Look and feel. Searching and sorting can be added etc
- Connection string can be fetched from Azure App Configuration or some external configuration source
- For validation we can create a servie or something
- DI can be used for service and repositories
- We can display only active losstypes
- We can display losstypes only created by that user
- Pagination can be made configurable 
- May be caching can be used if losstypes are not frequently changing data
